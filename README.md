This project creates a local hub to display how different factors (caffeine intake, exercise, etc) affect sleep efficiency. The results are based on the data set about sleep efficiency included in the download.

How to run the project:

1. Download the folder containing the python files and data set.

2. Install the following libraries*:
	- Plotly
	- Dash

*These are additional libraries to the ones included in the CSE 163 Python environment

3. Open the folder in VSCode

4. Run index.py for the dash app

5. Run main.py for the machine learning model 


The data set used is included in the download, but here is the source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency
To download the data set (if desired), make an account on Kaggle and find the dark gray download button in the top right side of the webpage.
